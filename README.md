A more detailed Model Summary can be found by selecting the [Model 1](https://gy19cp.github.io/model1summary.html) webpage on the website.

This animated agent-based model uses Sheep and Foxes within an raster grid environment. Sheep move, eat, share food with neighbouring Sheep and are unfortunately killed by Foxes. Foxes move and eat Sheep up to a specific food capacity. 

### Model Files/Directories List
-	[Developer Model*](https://gy19cp.github.io/developermodel.py) - Recommended Model to download and run as it contains detailed explanatory comments, testing and debugging. 
-	[User Model](https://gy19cp.github.io/usermodel.py) - Basic comments.
-	[Agent Framework*](https://gy19cp.github.io/agentframework.py) - Code for Agents in the Model.
-	[in.txt*](https://gy19cp.github.io/in.txt) - Text file that contains the values for the Environment. 
- [License](https://github.com/gy19cp/GEOG5990Assessment1/blob/master/LICENSE) - GNU General Public License v3.0 agreement for the Repository code.
- [Pycache](https://github.com/gy19cp/GEOG5990Assessment1/tree/master/__pycache__) - Folder directory automatically generated by Python containing bytecode cache files. 

The __*__ indicates files are essential to download to run the model. 
These files download once selected. The in.txt file opens in the same tab so it is advised to open in a new tab or save the in.txt file, before selecting the back command to return to this page.

## Model Instructions 

**Step 1 -** Open Spyder (Anaconda 3). If you have not got this downloaded, it can be installed through the Anaconda Distribution [here](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/). All code works with Python 3.7. Ensure when going through the installation process that you download ‘Spyder’.

**Step 2 -** Download the necessary files by clicking on the following hyperlinks - [User Model](http://gy19cp.github.io/usermodel.py), [Developer Model](http://gy19cp.github.io/developermodel.py), [Agent Framework](http://gy19cp.github.io/agentframework.py) and [in.txt](https://gy19cp.github.io/in.txt). All these files should be downloaded to the computers ‘Downloads’ folder. The User Model contains basic comments for ease for the user. The Developer Model version contains explanatory comments, testing, and debugging. 

**Alternative Step 2 -** Complete Step 2 above or this step, not both. Alternatively you can select this [Repository](https://github.com/gy19cp/GEOG5990Assessment1) hyperlink, which will take you directly to the Assessment 1 Repository within the GitHub website. Once in the Repository, select the green ‘Clone or download’ button (on the right side) and ‘Download Zip’. The files downloaded to the ‘Downloads’ folder this way will need to be ‘extracted’ before they appear as individual files as shown below. Both Step 2 methods are effective and up to personal preference.

**Step 3 -** Once downloaded, open Spyder and open the Agent Framework file and the selected Model (either the User/Developer version). 

**Step 4 -** Have the ‘agentframework’ file selected within Spyder and click the green right-pointed arrow to ‘Run’ it.

**Step 5 -** Now select the ‘model’ file within Spyder and click ‘Run’ again. This time a box entitled ‘Model’ should pop out. Click the subheading ‘Menu’ and ‘Run Model’.

## Model Expectations 
When the model is run, the orange dots represent ‘Foxes’ and the white dots represent ‘Sheep’. When a Sheep is killed by a Fox, the coordinates of where it took place is printed in the IPython Console. Where grass has been eaten, dark squares/pixels are shown. The darker the square/pixels, the more the grass has been grazed by multiple Sheep. This model will run until the Agents (Foxes) Food Store Capacity is met or until a specific number of steps (‘num_of_iterations’) has been completed. 

Estimated Model Running Time is..... Timing may vary slightly with different computer processing speeds and how many agents are chosen to be within the Model. Here the optimum number of 5 Foxes and 15 Sheep were ran, these best show the model capabilities. 

## Potential Known Issues
- A strong internet connection is required as the web scraped html file for the Foxes movement will not work without an internet connection. The HTTPConnectionPool error will show if the internet is not connected.
- It is recommended to open the Model on a Windows Operating System. However, when doing so a pop up box entitled 'Figure' will appear alongside the 'Model' box. This is a preknown issue that occurs with Windows. This Figure box is not used. To close the Model fully before potentially rerunning the Model again, both the Model and the Figure box need to be closed and the red square in the IPython console selected (if it is not already greyed out).

## Testing Completed
- Throughout the Agent Framework and Model, certain text is printed or 'returned' to show a certain action has occurred. For instance, 'Foxes Food Store Capacity is met' is printed. 
- Also 'if' and 'else' statements are used to cover if one outcome does not occur then another outcome will happen instead. For instance, the Sheep movement is random. If the number generated is > 0.5, both the xy coordinates increase by 1 and the Sheep moves North or East. If the number generated is < 0.5, both xy coordinates decrease by 1 and the Sheep moves  South or West.

## Final Points
I do not condon any form of animal cruelty. This model was only to represent skills developed following the [Programming for Geographical Information Analysts: Core Skills module](https://www.geog.leeds.ac.uk/courses/computing/study/core-python/) as part of an MSc GIS from the University of Leeds.
